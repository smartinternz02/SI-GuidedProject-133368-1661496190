Project Description:
If a hospital has multiple readmissions, it means that the hospital needs to work on the quality of services it is providing with respect to the health and wellness of its patients.  Being able to predict whether a person will be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days or not, will be of great help to the hospital in developing an idea of the incoming number of repeated patients which in turn helps to provide better services for patients with increased risk of disease.       

One patient population that is at increased risk of hospitalization and readmission is diabetes. Diabetes is a medical condition that affects approximately 1 in 10 patients in the United States.  So in this project, we will be focusing on hospital readmission prediction for patients who are having diabetes.

This study used the Health Facts database (Cerner Corporation, Kansas City, MO), a national data warehouse that collects comprehensive clinical records across hospitals throughout the United States.  The Health Facts data we used was an extract representing 10 years (1999â€“2008) of clinical care at 130 hospitals and integrated delivery networks throughout the United States.

The main purpose of this project is to predict whether a person who is suffering from diabetes and consulting a specific hospital will be readmitted or not, based on multiple factors.

We will be using classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and GradientBoost. We will train and test the data with these algorithms. From this, the best model is selected and saved in pkl format. We will also be deploying our model locally using Flask.
